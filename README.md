# Primordial Analytics Consulting, LLC.

Welcome to the open source repo for [our web site](https://www.primordialanalytics.com)! We strongly believe in the value of open source and sharing knowledge that has common value. Feel free to dig around in our code and see how we've modified a free template from Start Bootstrap.

# Howto

One of our founders has an affinity for cosmology and astrophysics: it's in the name, the logo, the font face, and our theme. So that movie on the front page, how did we make that? It's super simple:
```bash
# get a movie file to work
$ wget https://nasaviz.gsfc.nasa.gov/vis/a010000/a010600/a010661/Galaxy_Evolution-tracking_shot2-1080p.mov 

# transform to an HTML5 friendly mp4 format
$ ffmpeg -i Galaxy_Evolution-tracking_shot-1080p.mov -vcodec copy -acodec copy galaxy.mp4

# compress the movie so it runs faster
$ ffmpeg -i galaxy.mp4 -filter:v "setpts=0.5*PTS" a.mp4

# trim to fit visually
$ ffmpeg -i a.mp4 -t 19 -c copy b.mp4
```

With the exception of a few dollars per month in AWS charges and our personal time, our web site was built for free. Why wouldn't we pay someone? Our web site is partly to demonstrate the power of the analytical individual and the strength of the open source community. When consultancies launch into wanting to sell software XYZ from proprietary vendor ABC, it's a way of creating lock-in for long-term work -- this is a linchpin in the "land and expand" business model. At Primordial, we take the opposite view: we want you to see our work and for your people to have access to the code. That's what we've done with our site.
