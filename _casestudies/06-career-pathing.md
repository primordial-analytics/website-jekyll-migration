**Client's Problem:** _"Our company is undergoing a transformation via
a re-org to better focus on the development of our people. We do not
have a legacy of strong technical leadership and thus are uncertain of
how to create a career pathing that is appealing to our younger tech
employees. This is a critical need for us now and going forward as it
impacts hiring and retention of people working on high-value
technology projects."_

Our Client was within range of several tech hotbeds and had the added
stress of competing against those markets. Providing extensive "perks"
inside the office, ala Silicon Valley, was not an option
unfortunately, and so the Client needed to be creative. We were a good
fit for this engagement based on our history of growing up with the
industry, and had some ideas that did not require getting into an arms
race with other companies.

Our initial interviews and scoping with employees in IT and HR
revealed survey data that painted a clear picture: the technical
people wanted to feel a sense of purpose, to be motivated by their
work, and have their work make a difference to the business. Common
desires for many people in the workplace, so we set to task on
combining these desires with a career trajectory.

The first order of business was to rewrite job descriptions based on
industry best practices and standards. We also created new titles,
duties, and responsibilities that reflected the kind of work people
were actually doing, going to be doing, and wanted to do. These jobs
were then tiered in seniority based on a combination of experience,
expertise, and merit to capture the upward mobility expected from
doing good work driven by passion.

Our industry experience has taught us that segregating technical
expertise from business leadership on distinct career tracts is a red
herring which demotivates technical people. Thus, we built into the
tiering managerial modifiers (manager, supervisors, etc.)  which could
be added to people's jobs as they grew into, and desired, those
responsibilities. The result was lengthy, but specific and valued,
titles such as Sr.  Data Architect, Manager or Principal Data
Scientist, Director.

With a career path mapped out, this did not address the desired
purpose, motivation, and difference making of the jobs. Our career
model was given life by including coaching (bought) and development
(built) processes that enforced a [plum tree][plum] paradigm where
management existed only to support. As a result, the people were empowered
to manage the work, and the managers managed the professional and technical
development of the people. This inversion encouraged everyone to self-motivate
because the individual now determined the purpose in their career path
and their work.
