**Client's Problem:** _"Our analysis department is overrun with
work, and our business partners don't have the people or resources to
self-service. Our people end-up being managed through their email
inbox with no coordination, meaning frustrated business partners,
duplicated work, cut corners (tech debt), no time for innovation, and
low morale. How do we fix this?"_

This client had a process problem. During the scoping and discovery
phase, we interviewed the analysts and they had plenty of enthusiasm,
talent, and skill. Likewise, their business partners possessed the
needed subject matter expertise and strategic vision to facilitate
high-quality analytics work.

The disconnect occurred in work coordination and specifically how the
analysts worked together. There was no "strength in numbers" credo or
prevailing spirit of "we succeed as a team, fail as individuals." To
rectify this issue, we designed a workload management process which
was a blend of agile methodologies and traditional governance.

The analysts self-selected groups of cross-functional "squads" with
business partners that had overlapping strategic needs. We also
created an informal "capability owner" role to help each squad take
strategic ownership of their work. These squads were taught a blend of
agile techniques (backlogs, sprints, stand-ups, reviews,
retrospectives, etc.) and encouraged to modify them to suit their
needs.

Additionally, a process for managing and governing work requests
was designed and implemented with the department and executive teams
to separate the distinct forms of work we found: PMO-governed
strategic projects, support, and ad hoc analytics. The outcome was
high-performing analytical teams embedded within the business. These
teams leveraged agile methods to manage their workloads while still
having the freedom to pursue development without rigid or formalized
overhead that would slow them down.
