**Client's Problem:** _"We really just want to know what
the future holds for sales. That knowledge impacts everything we do."_

This problem is so common that there are thousands of off-the-shelf
solutions. All the big companies ([Salesforce][salesforce],
[Tableau][tableau], [SAP][sap], [MicroStrategy][microstrategy], et al.)
have robust forecasting
tools baked into their desktop or cloud software that only require the
press of a button. During scoping, we pressed the Client hard on the
validity of their "build versus buy" decision. We offered our own
insights and assessment as well, but they had several excellent
strategic reasons for wanting to create their own solution.

As with any problem, we went hunting in the Client's data and their
industry data for patterns. We found no shortage of those: temporal,
spatial, by segment, by category, by... everything. What we found were
too many patterns. Something didn't add up: it was like we were
looking at a single data set in spite of the data sets being so
disparate.  This was the signature of a coupled system with a
driver. So, we unearthed the small number of driving forces in the
system.

With the underlying drivers known, we modeled them using a combination
of traditional statistical techniques and modern machine learning
models. The models produced the accuracy the Client desired on the
time horizon relevant to their decisions. Mission accomplished! But
was it?

Using the knowledge we gained about the demand patterns in their
industry, we saw a unique opportunity for the Client to acquire,
collect, and curate novel data associated with their industry. As the
Client's liaison, we worked with third parties to design several
strategic initiatives to tackle the data acquisition. The new data was
later folded into the demand modeling as market share features and
further improved the models utility as a strategic tool.
